              An event hub is a concept that enables developers to get access to
              real-time business events from one developer portal.

              The majority of B2B processes are by their nature asynchronous and
              event-driven. A transaction occurs in a processing system (e.g.
              your ERP system) and that triggers a message to be sent to a
              partner.

              This makes webhook APIs a perfect fit for B2B messaging. Not only
              are they a perfect fit but they add value over existing
              technologies that are used in this space (such as EDI).

              webhook API solution for B2B purposes is security and robustness.

              One of the main challenges organizations have is ensuring data is
              retrieved from the system of record, rather than another
